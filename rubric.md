### Answers:

1. When I have succeed 2 things need to be true,
	1. I will have made at least one game that I can demonstrate to some one and list the reasons it is a good game
	2. I will have made enough money from at least one game to support the continued production of games.

2. If I have done any of these then I have failed:
	* I have not **finished (released)** any games
	* I have not released any games that I can justify as being **good**
	* I have not **learned** anything from my endeavours.
	* I don't have the **courage to try again**.

3. Yes. In an ideal world it's not important to make money and I can just focus only on what I am interested.
Unfortunately I have obligations to my family, and my community to provide something of value, and support myself with
my efforts, so where money is concerned it is important to fullfill these responsabilities and not more. More is nice, but not
necessary.

4. Yes. If I am not making something that I deem to have value then I am a leech on my community and should be stopped.
I must be able to present technical examples of what makes my game good, and why it is deserving of recognition. My game should
be:
	1. **fast** - it should run without issue on all target hardware
	2. **fun** - it should have a deep mechanic with a satisfying loop, that keeps you engaged by merely existing and not through cosmetic fluff.
	3. **frugal** - it should not consume an inordinate amount of resources(system, hardware and human [it should not be an addicting time waster])

5. It will have satisfied # 3 and # 4 completely

6. When I am at risk of harming those I care about with the endeavor. (i.e. total financial instability, relationship destruction, run away occupational health problems)

7. Probably, but I can't think of anything.

8. I couldn't say for sure untill I try. Ask me again in a year.
